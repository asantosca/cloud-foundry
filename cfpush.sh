NAME
     cfpush.sh -- pushes the current app to Cloud Foundry

**Usage**

For a java project, create the jar and place it in the location determined by the key "target" in your manifest.yml.

To push that jar to Cloud Foundry, simply type cfpush.sh at the command line, in the same folder in which the file manifest.yml is located.

By default cfpush.sh will push a custom app, which is the name of the current app appended with the name of the current user.
The reason for that is because the most common use case is for pushing custom apps, that need to be clearly identified by user.
If you want to push an app with a different name, use the "-a" argument

**Arguments**
The following options are available:

-a or -appname     Application name. If different than the current app.
-i or -instances   Number of instances being pushed. Default is 1.
-m or -manifest    Shows the manifest file created, but doesn't push the app to Cloud Foundry
